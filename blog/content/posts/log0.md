## Time for a Change

Time flies, and it's already December 1st. Since this is the beginning of a new month, I want to make some changes to how I approach learning in order to make this month counts. Yes, even though this is the last month of 2024, I just want to size the time I have to actually take my study seriously so that I can become a better version for my next role.

## Who am I

First of all, some background about myself and how I've got here, I left my full-time developer job at a startup not so long ago because I was stifled by the lack of growth and complacency there. I didn't want to just get by and pretend to do important work in order to earn a paycheque. After quitting, I tried to dive back into full-time learning mode while doing some part-time work to keep the lights on and pay my bills. However, learning by myself is extremely hard and requires a lot of discipline as well as a clear plan, which are something that I didn't really have after quitting my job. Without hard work, discipline, and most importantly a decently clear plan, it's easy to get lost in the amount of stuff you should/can learn on your own, and studying anything in tech is overwhelming because everything is advancing so quickly.

## My Struggle

For the past 2 months, I tried to go back to the fundamentals (programming, data structure, algorithms, design patterns and so on), and meanwhile I continued to try out different things and build projects on my own. Through my learning and working on projects, I've maintained my ability to read and write code properly. But soon I realised that I have difficulty retaining what I have learned or studied. It seems that no matter how hard I tried the things I learned don't really stick. It feels like I'm trying to get water with a leaky bucket, and obviously this is not good!

## A New Path Forward

To address the issue, I took some time to do some reflections, and I have come to the conclusion that I've not done enough volume and my level of focus is now. As a result, even though it may seem like I'm learning, I am actually just scratching the surface. Moving on, I'm going to do something different.

Since I have recognised that pursuing the study of computing and information is worthwhile, I need to build a strong foundation to actually make things stick. It sounds philosophical, but I believe this is what it takes to actually go far in any field of study. For me (at least currently), the foundation of computing and information is to solve problem and manage complexity around us. To explore this, I'm willing the go at great length and really be patient about my journey instead of jumping from one thing to another and allowing myself to be distracted by the noise around us.

So without further a due, the journey begins today, and this time around, I'm going to be more emphasise on output rather than just absorbing knowledge. That's why I'm writing a log file like this to document my learning journey.
